### Todos

- [x] humanize numbers
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] highlight Duration: 44ms in yellow or something to set it apart.
- [ ] Add back Triggers struct in Explain
- [ ] I think maybe join Inner and (swimmers.coach_id = coaches.id) should be highlighted in a different color from the other stuff, but the same color as each other. so...maybe a pale blue?
- [ ] (Lower priority) I think it should (optionally) have line numbers. Then when you share it with someone you can say "look at line 23" (for possible HTML/PDF)
- [ ] 2 color pallettes
