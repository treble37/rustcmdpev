### Todos

- [x] humanize numbers
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] highlight Duration: 44ms in yellow or something to set it apart.
- [ ] Add back Triggers struct in Explain
- [ ] I think maybe join Inner and (swimmers.coach_id = coaches.id) should be highlighted in a different color from the other stuff, but the same color as each other. so...maybe a pale blue?
- [ ] (Lower priority) I think it should (optionally) have line numbers. Then when you share it with someone you can say "look at line 23" (for possible HTML/PDF)
- [ ] 2 color pallettes

# ChatGPT 5 Todos

Here‚Äôs a focused refactor checklist for **treble37/rustcmdpev**‚Äîprioritized to modernize the project structure, improve UX, reliability, and make ongoing maintenance easy.

### Project scaffolding & packaging

* [ ] Convert to a **workspace** with a `lib` crate (`rustcmdpev-core`) and a `bin` crate (`rustcmdpev`) so parsing/formatting logic is reusable from tests and other tools. (Repo is currently a single binary CLI per README usage.) ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Add **GitHub Actions** CI (replace `.travis.yml`, which is deprecated) for `build`, `test`, `clippy`, and `fmt` on Linux/macOS/Windows. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Publish **versioned releases** with binaries for the 3 OSes (use `cargo-dist` or `cross` + Actions); README says ‚Äúmanual install‚Äù, which hurts adoption. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Define and document **MSRV** (e.g., Rust 1.xx) and enforce via CI.
* [ ] Add `LICENSE` header checks (already MIT licensed) and `cargo-deny` audit.

### CLI & UX

* [ ] Switch to **`clap`** (derive) for flags/subcommands:
  `rustcmdpev [--input plan.json] [--format {pretty,json,table}] [--color auto|always|never] [--theme dark|light]`
  (README implies stdin piping only; add file input & output modes.) ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Provide **helpful errors** and exit codes; adopt `anyhow` for top-level error bubble and `thiserror` for domain errors.
* [ ] Support **Windows consoles** and TTY color detection; gate colors with `--color` and respect `NO_COLOR`.
* [ ] Add **progress/verbose** logging via `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` (`RUST_LOG` control).

### Core design (parsing & model)

* [ ] Define **strongly-typed serde models** for Postgres EXPLAIN (JSON) fields (Plan/Node, costs, buffers, timings), isolating ‚Äúraw JSON‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúdomain model‚Äù conversion in `parser` module. README shows you expect JSON EXPLAIN piped in. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Represent the plan as a **tree** with well-typed `PlanNode { kind, children, costs, rows, width, buffer_hits, ‚Ä¶ }`.
* [ ] Add a **schema-aware adapter** that tolerates Postgres version differences (optional fields) with `#[serde(default)]` and `Option<T>`.
* [ ] Validate inputs early with a **`PlanValidation`** phase (e.g., root node presence, numeric sanity checks).

### Rendering & output

* [ ] Split into `render` module with pluggable **renderers**:

  * Text (ASCII tree; width-aware wrapping)
  * Table (using `comfy-table`)
  * JSON passthrough/normalized JSON (for chaining in scripts)
* [ ] Add **themes** (light/dark/no-color) and condensed vs verbose modes.
* [ ] Output **explain summaries** (total cost, total time, loops, memory, buffers) at the top for quick scan.

### Performance & memory

* [ ] Prefer **zero-copy** deserialization where practical (e.g., `Cow<'_, str>`), and avoid unnecessary string allocations in renderers.
* [ ] Consider **streaming parse** (`serde_json::Deserializer::from_reader(std::io::stdin())`) to handle large plans without loading entire input into memory.
* [ ] Micro-opt: pre-compute aggregate metrics (total rows, cost ranges) once, reuse during rendering.

### Testing & quality

* [ ] Add **golden tests** with `insta` snapshots for each renderer (text/table/json) using a small set of sample plans (there is a `tests/` dir and a `sql_test.txt` in the repo‚Äîformalize them). ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Unit tests for parsing oddities (missing fields, different Postgres versions), and for CLI arg edge cases.
* [ ] Add **property tests** (`proptest`) for plan tree invariants (e.g., costs ‚â• 0, children count matches).
* [ ] Enable **strict lints**: `#![deny(warnings)]`, `clippy::pedantic` (allow where noisy), and add a `rustfmt.toml`.

### Developer experience

* [ ] Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and **issue templates**; currently repo has minimal guidance. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Add `examples/` with small **EXPLAIN** JSON samples and a `make demo` (README shows a sample `cargo run -- '[{...}]'`; provide files). ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Document **installation via cargo** (`cargo install rustcmdpev`) once published to crates.io.
* [ ] Add **badges** in README: crates.io, docs.rs, CI status (README currently shows build status image and basic usage). ([GitHub][1])

### Cross-platform & integration

* [ ] Provide **psql helpers** for Linux/macOS/Windows (PowerShell example) to prepend `EXPLAIN` automatically (README gives a macOS `pbpaste` one-liner; add others). ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Add `--postgres-version` hint if you ever need version-specific parsing quirks.
* [ ] Optional: **Postgres connection mode** (feature-flagged) to run EXPLAIN directly (use `tokio-postgres`), keeping default as stdin for portability.

### Observability & telemetry (opt-in)

* [ ] Gate anonymous **usage metrics** behind a feature flag/env var; never default on. Useful to learn which renderers/flags are used.

### Release engineering

* [ ] Automated **changelog** with `git-cliff`.
* [ ] **Semantic versioning** and tags; publish **prebuilt tarballs** with checksums and a Homebrew tap and/or Scoop manifest.

# Augment Todos (Claude Sonet 4)
I'll analyze the rustcmdpev repository to provide refactoring suggestions. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure and understanding the current implementation.

Now let me explore the source code structure to understand the implementation:

Let me examine the structure modules and test files to get a complete picture:

Let me also check for any additional files that might provide context:

Now let me check the git history to understand the evolution and any patterns:

Based on my analysis of the rustcmdpev codebase, I can now provide comprehensive refactoring suggestions. Let me create a structured list of refactoring recommendations:
